This document lists all 111 admin configuration issues that need to be addressed for proper Django admin functionality.

---

## üìä **SUMMARY**

- **Total Issues**: 111
- **Categories**:

## üî¥ **CRITICAL - MODEL CONFLICTS (Must Fix First)**

### 1. AuditLog Model Clash
**Issue**: Two AuditLog models exist with conflicting reverse accessors

**Models**:
- `core.AuditLog`
- `system_config.AuditLog`

**Error**:
```
core.AuditLog.user: Reverse accessor 'User.audit_logs' clashes with 'system_config.AuditLog.user'
```

**Solution Options**:
1. **Option A (Recommended)**: Remove `system_config.AuditLog`, use only `core.AuditLog`
2. **Option B**: Add `related_name='system_config_logs'` to `system_config.AuditLog.user`
3. **Option C**: Consolidate both into one AuditLog model

## üìã **ACTION PLAN**

### Step 1: Model Review (8-12 hours)
For each model with admin errors:
1. Open the model file
2. List all actual fields
3. Compare with admin configuration
4. Document discrepancies

### Step 2: Decision Making (2-4 hours)
For each discrepancy, decide:
- **Add field to model?** (if it makes sense)
- **Remove from admin?** (if field isn't needed)
- **Rename/update?** (if field name changed)

### Step 3: Implementation (6-8 hours)
- Update admin configurations
- Or update models
- Create migrations if models changed
- Test each admin interface

### Step 4: Verification (2-4 hours)
- Run `python manage.py check`
- Verify all admin pages load
- Test CRUD operations in admin
- Document any remaining issues

        print(f"\n=== {app_config.name} ===")
        for model in app_config.get_models():
            print(f"\n{model.__name__}:")
            for field in model._meta.fields:
                print(f"  - {field.name}: {field.__class__.__name__}")

## üìö **REFERENCE**

### Common Patterns

#### Pattern 1: is_active field
Many models inherit `is_active` from `CompanyIsolatedModel` but admin tries to reference it.
**Solution**: This should work if inheritance is correct. Check model definition.

#### Pattern 2: created_by / owner fields
Some admins reference `created_by` but models have `owner` or vice versa.
**Solution**: Standardize on one pattern across the codebase.

#### Pattern 3: timestamp fields
Some models have `created_at`, `updated_at`, others may have different names.
**Solution**: Check CompanyIsolatedModel base class for inherited fields.
