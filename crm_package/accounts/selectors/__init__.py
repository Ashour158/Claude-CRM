Account selectors - Data retrieval layer.

Selectors are pure data-fetching functions that encapsulate query logic.
They should not contain business logic or side effects, only data retrieval
with appropriate filtering and optimization.

Example future structure:
    - get_account_by_id(account_id) -> Account
    - list_accounts(filters) -> QuerySet[Account]
    - get_account_with_contacts(account_id) -> Account (with related data)
