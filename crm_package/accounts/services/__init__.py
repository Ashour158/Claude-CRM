Account services - Business logic layer.

Services contain the business logic for account operations. They should be
the primary entry point for any account-related operations that require
business rules, validation, or coordination across multiple models.

Example future structure:
    - create_account(data) -> Account
    - update_account(account_id, data) -> Account
    - delete_account(account_id) -> bool
    - assign_account_owner(account_id, user_id) -> Account
