# 🏗️ CRM Architecture Restructure - Phase 1 Complete

## What Was Done

This PR introduces a **new domain-centric CRM package structure** (`crm_package/`) with foundational multi-tenancy support. This is **Phase 1: Scaffolding** - no existing code has been modified or moved yet.

## 📦 New Package: `crm_package/`

A complete, modular structure has been created with:

### ✅ Core Features
- **11 Domain Modules**: accounts, contacts, leads, deals, activities, products, marketing, vendors, sales, workflow, territories
- **Multi-Tenancy Foundation**: Row-level tenancy using ContextVar-based organization context
- **Service/Selector Pattern**: Separation of business logic (services) from data retrieval (selectors)
- **Shared Utilities**: Common enums, validators, mixins, and helper functions
- **System Module**: For configuration and settings management

### 🔐 Tenancy Scaffolding (Not Yet Enabled)
- `crm_package/core/tenancy/context.py` - Organization context management
- `crm_package/core/tenancy/middleware.py` - Request-level tenant resolution (placeholder)
- `crm_package/core/tenancy/mixins.py` - TenantOwnedModel abstract base
- `crm_package/core/tenancy/selectors.py` - Tenant access helpers

### 📚 Documentation
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md` - Complete 7-phase migration roadmap
- `docs/TENANCY_STRATEGY.md` - Row-level multi-tenancy implementation details
- `docs/SHIMS_REMOVAL_CHECKLIST.md` - Process for removing legacy code

### 🎯 Design Patterns
Each domain module follows the same structure:
```
domain/
├── models/      # Data models (to be migrated)
├── services/    # Business logic & writes
├── selectors/   # Data retrieval & queries
├── api/         # REST endpoints
└── tests/       # Domain tests
```

## 🚨 No Breaking Changes

**Important**: This is scaffolding only. No existing code has been modified:
- ✅ Legacy flat files (`crm_accounts_models.py`, etc.) still exist and work
- ✅ Existing imports unchanged
- ✅ No database changes
- ✅ No settings changes
- ✅ Package works without Django (graceful import degradation)

## 📊 What's Different from Before

### Before (Current State)
```
/
├── crm_accounts_models.py          # Flat file at root
├── crm_accounts_serializers.py     # Flat file at root
├── crm_accounts_views.py           # Flat file at root
├── crm_contacts_models.py          # Flat file at root
└── ...                             # More flat files
```

### After Phase 1 (Scaffolding Added)
```
/
├── crm_accounts_models.py          # Still here (unchanged)
├── crm_accounts_serializers.py     # Still here (unchanged)
└── crm_package/                    # NEW - Future home
    ├── accounts/
    │   ├── models/     # Future location
    │   ├── services/   # Business logic
    │   └── selectors/  # Query logic
    ├── contacts/       # Same structure
    ├── core/
    │   └── tenancy/    # Multi-tenancy foundation
    └── shared/         # Common utilities
```

## 🗺️ Migration Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Scaffolding (COMPLETE)
- Create directory structure
- Add tenancy scaffolding
- Document architecture

### 🔄 Phase 2: Migrate Accounts (Next)
- Move Account model to `crm_package.accounts.models`
- Create shims for backward compatibility
- Implement services and selectors
- Update imports

### 📅 Phases 3-7 (Planned)
- Migrate remaining domains
- Enable /api/v1/ routing
- Apply tenancy to models
- Remove all shims
- Full cleanup

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md` for complete timeline.

## 🧪 Testing

All imports work without errors:

```python
# Basic import
import crm_package
assert crm_package.__version__ == "0.1.0"

# Tenancy context
from crm_package.core.tenancy import get_current_organization_id
org_id = get_current_organization_id()  # Works!

# Domain modules
from crm_package.accounts import services, selectors
# All 11 domains importable
```

Run structure tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_crm_package_structure.py
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Working with Tenancy Context
```python
from crm_package.core.tenancy import (
    set_current_organization_id,
    get_current_organization_id
)
import uuid

# Set organization for current request
org_id = uuid.uuid4()
set_current_organization_id(org_id)

# Context automatically used in selectors
current_org = get_current_organization_id()
```

### Service Pattern (Future)
```python
from crm_package.accounts.services import create_account

account = create_account(
    name="ACME Corp",
    owner_id=user.id,
    industry="Technology"
)
```

### Selector Pattern (Future)
```python
from crm_package.accounts.selectors import list_accounts

accounts = list_accounts(filters={'industry': 'Technology'})
```

## 🎓 Key Benefits

1. **Discoverability**: Clear where each domain's code lives
2. **Maintainability**: Service layer enforces business rules in one place
3. **Testability**: Services/selectors can be tested independently
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new domains with standard structure
5. **Multi-Tenancy**: Built into foundation, not bolted on later
6. **Team Collaboration**: Clear ownership boundaries reduce conflicts

## 🔍 Architecture Comparison

This structure aligns with commercial CRM patterns:
- **Salesforce**: Objects → Our domain modules
- **HubSpot**: Tools → Our domain modules  
- **Dynamics 365**: Entities → Our domain modules

Row-level tenancy is the standard starting point for SaaS applications, with ability to evolve to schema-per-tenant if needed.

## 📁 Files Added

### Package Structure (150+ files)
- `crm_package/` - Complete package with all domains
- `crm_package/core/tenancy/` - Multi-tenancy support
- `crm_package/shared/` - Common utilities

### Documentation (3 files)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md` (14KB)
- `docs/TENANCY_STRATEGY.md` (15KB)
- `docs/SHIMS_REMOVAL_CHECKLIST.md` (10KB)

### Tests
- `tests/test_crm_package_structure.py` - Verify imports work

### Other
- `crm_package/README.md` - Package documentation
- `.gitignore` - Exclude __pycache__ and build artifacts

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Not Yet Enabled
The tenancy middleware is **NOT** in `MIDDLEWARE` settings. It's scaffolding for future use.

### Legacy Code Unchanged  
All existing flat files still work. No imports need updating yet.

### Phase 2 Required
To actually use the new structure, Phase 2 must complete the accounts migration and create shims.

## 🤝 For Developers

### When Adding New Code
Consider using the new structure even before full migration:
```python
# New pattern
from crm_package.accounts import services
services.create_account(name="Test")

# Old pattern (still works)
from crm_accounts_models import Account
Account.objects.create(name="Test")
```

### Code Review Focus
- Verify new imports use `crm_package.*`
- Ensure tenant filtering in selectors
- Check service layer for business logic

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Complete directory skeleton created
- ✅ Tenancy modules present and importable
- ✅ Service/selector stubs in place
- ✅ All domain modules importable
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Package works without Django
- ✅ CI remains green (no new test failures)
