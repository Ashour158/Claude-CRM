## 🔴 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 5 Critical Issues Identified

| # | Issue | Severity | CVSS | Impact | Effort | Document |
|---|-------|----------|------|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Default SECRET_KEY fallback | CRITICAL | 9.8 | Full system compromise | 4h | Security Report p.2 |
| 2 | Missing email verification | CRITICAL | 8.5 | Spam/fake accounts | 8h | Security Report p.3 |
| 3 | Incomplete 2FA | CRITICAL | 8.1 | Account takeover | 16h | Security Report p.4 |
| 4 | Insufficient rate limiting | CRITICAL | 7.5 | Brute force attacks | 4h | Security Report p.5 |
| 5 | Local file storage | CRITICAL | N/A | Cannot scale | 16h | System Analysis p.10 |

**Total Critical Fix Time:** 48 hours (Week 1 mandatory)

### Why These Matter

1. **DEFAULT SECRET_KEY (CVSS 9.8)**
   - Enables session hijacking, CSRF bypass
   - Complete authentication bypass possible
   - **Cannot deploy to production without fixing**

2. **EMAIL VERIFICATION (CVSS 8.5)**
   - Unverified emails can register
   - GDPR compliance violation
   - Spam and abuse potential

3. **INCOMPLETE 2FA (CVSS 8.1)**
   - Password-only authentication vulnerable
   - SOC 2 compliance requirement
   - Account takeover risk

4. **RATE LIMITING (CVSS 7.5)**
   - Brute force attacks possible
   - Account enumeration
   - DDoS vulnerability

5. **FILE STORAGE (Infrastructure)**
   - Cannot scale horizontally
   - Single point of failure
   - Production blocker
