- **High-throughput discovery**: TripleTOF 6600+, ZenoTOF 7600

### **For Clinical Labs:**
- **Regulatory compliance**: TSQ series, QTRAP systems
- **Routine targeted assays**: Triple Quad platforms
- **Robustness and reliability**: SCIEX QTRAP, Thermo TSQ series
- **Ease of use**: Echo MS, TSQ Quantis

### **Hybrid Research/Clinical:**
- **TripleTOF 6600+** - Can perform both discovery and targeted work
- **Orbitrap Exploris** - Research-grade with clinical potential
- **QTRAP systems** - Targeted quantitation with discovery capabilities

The choice depends on specific applications, throughput requirements, budget, and whether you need discovery proteomics, targeted quantitation, or both capabilities in one platform.

**Hamilton Vantage Platform**
- High-throughput system for large-scale genomics operations
- Batch processing capabilities for 96/384-well formats
- Ideal for clinical genomics labs with high sample volumes

## **Beckman Coulter Solutions**

**Biomek i-Series (i5, i7)**
- Proven reliability in genomics applications
- Strong integration with Beckman's reagent portfolio
- Excellent for routine sample prep workflows
- Good cost-to-performance ratio

**Biomek FXP**
- High-precision multichannel pipetting
- Suitable for complex genomics protocols
- Integrated environmental controls

## **Other Leading Options**

**Tecan Fluent Series**
- Exceptional flexibility and protocol customization

- Excellent for DNA/RNA extraction
- Compact footprint, good for smaller labs

**Agilent Bravo Platform**
- Reliable for NGS library preparation
- Good integration with Agilent's genomics reagents
- User-friendly interface

## **Selection Criteria to Consider**

1. **Throughput Requirements**: Daily sample volume
2. **Protocol Complexity**: Simple extractions vs. complex library prep
3. **Integration Needs**: Compatibility with existing lab equipment
4. **Budget**: Initial cost plus ongoing consumables/maintenance
5. **Lab Space**: Footprint and environmental requirements
6. **Staff Training**: Learning curve and ongoing support needs

## **2024 Trends**

- Increased focus on walkaway automation
- Better integration with LIMS systems
- Enhanced contamination prevention features
- Improved support for single-cell genomics workflows

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific system or discuss how to evaluate these options for your particular workflow requirements?
